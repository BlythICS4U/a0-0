# a0-0

In this assignment, you will:
* Clone a repository
* Edit a file
* Commit your changed file
* Submit your assignment

We will be using the Github desktop application to access the assignment material and make our changes.

* Open the Github desktop application and clone the assignment repository (a0-0-username)
  * This will create a local copy of the repository residing on Github
* To make reviewing your work easier, our changes will be made in branches and then pull requested to the master branch
  * Create a new branch called "develop" (this will be the standard branch name for all of our assignments)
  * Ensure that "develop" is selected in the branch drop down
* Locate the assignment directory and open the editMe.txt file (use any text editor)
* Replace my name with your name
* Replace my email address with your email address
* Save the file and exit
* Return to Github desktop verify that you have 1 uncommitted change (you can also see the diff of the editMe file)
* We now commit this change to our local assignment repository
  * In the summary field, enter a commit message (e.g. Updated personal data in editMe.txt)
  * Click the "Commit to develop" button
* We will now create a pull request to submit our assignment work
  * Click the "pull request" button
  * The dialog that appears should have pre-populated with your commit summary and show that the develop branch is being merged to the master branch
  * Click the "Send Pull Request" button

Congrats!  You have just submitted a pull request for your work.  If you view your a0-0 repository on Github, you will see that there is 1 pull request listed.  In future assignments that require code changes, this pull request mechanism will make it very easy for me to see the work you've done and provide feedback.
